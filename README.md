## Overview and Origin

* Splunk

* Splunk was incorporated in 2003

* The founders of Splunk are Erik Swan, Michael Baum, Rob Das

* The idea for the Splunk product came about due to the companies struggling with "information caves". The company's initial aim was to simplify collection and management of big data and easily search for the data within (through functionalities like Rex) to recognize data patterns and potential problems. Then they could apply that operational intelligence to create alerts, analytical reports, interactive graphs, etc for easy visulaizations and use for the businesses to be able to act on it. Splunk can gather any form of data including JSON, CSV and log formats.

* Splunk is a public trading company.

* Some of the core metrics that companies in AI field use to measure success and how Splunk is performing are as follows:
  - Quality i.e. data accuracy, efficiency, security , and scalability of AI models to be able to provide valuable insights. Splunk's products provide comprehensive security, observability and insights.
  - Cost effectiveness - Deploying Splunk can be a bit expensive.Some alternative tools to Splunk can be Datadog, Graylog, Elastisearch, Sumo Logic, Kibana though comparative cost analysis will be needed for these alternate solutions for the businesses to determine the best suited product for their needs.
 - Business Impact - Splunk's products have a made a huge impact worldwide and has been able to benefit many companies so far. A few examples are as follows:

    - Splunk automated time consuming tasks at Ersilia, and increased it's capacity to build AI models that could potentially help billions of underserved patients around the world.
 - Responsible AI - A responsible, trustworthy, and legislative compliant AI strategy is needed while solving business challenges and delivering customer value. The key to achieving responsible and trustworthy AI is accountability, transparency, privacy, fairness and resilience, and Splunk embraces these principles. Their AI products are driven by Domain specific for security and observability, maintaining human's in the loop i.e. AI and humans are co-pilots working alongside to deliver facts, summarize events, and bring priority alerts to the forefront, and finally allowing Splunk models to be integrated into customer's own models according to their policies and risk tolerance, providing flexible solutions. They also have a board-level committee called Cybersecurity & Data Responsibility Committee that ensures above AI principles/metrics are followed.
* Though Splunk's tool dashboard is not as reliable as Tableau and Open source tools are constantly trying to replace Splunk, Splunk has been doing well in comparison to others in the same field and Cisco wants to acquire Splunk. Cisco is expected to acquire Splunk in late Q1 or early Q2 2024 , pending regulatory approvals, for $28 billion in equity value, or $157 per share.
* 

## Recommendations

* I would recommend Splunk because of it's sleuth of operational and cyber security improvement capabilities as well as focus on Responsible AI and automation. Since there are 98-100 technologies used by Splunk , the recommendation of the technology and product will have to be dependent on each business' specific need.
