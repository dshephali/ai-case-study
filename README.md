# SPLUNK & AI Technology

## Overview and Origin

* Splunk was incorporated in 2003

* The founders of Splunk are Erik Swan, Michael Baum, Rob Das

* The idea for the Splunk product came about due to the companies struggling with "information caves". The company's initial aim was to simplify collection and management of big data and easily search for the data within (through functionalities like Rex) to recognize data patterns and potential problems. Then they could apply that operational intelligence to create alerts, analytical reports, interactive graphs, etc for easy visualizations and use for the businesses to be able to act on it. Splunk can gather any form of data including JSON, CSV and log formats.

* Splunk is a public trading company.

## Business Activities

* The company is trying to solve Cyber threats, hybrid, multi-cloud computing complexity related security threats , and operational inefficiencies, as well as continue to innovate with AI to     "provide comprehensive security and observability solutions capable of delivering digital resilience at enterprise scale."
  
* The company aims at giving customers enterprise control over their multiple tools/apps, data collection, usage, and cost through their unified platform , thus increasing visibility across multiple global business units. They also use automation for threat intelligence/analysis to improve applications and infrastructure.

* Splunk's main customers are security, IT Operations/ DevOps and business. Their customers range from US Govt to Telecommunication, Insurance, Hospitality industry etc. They are not only expanding in US but have also expanded into Europe and Asia-Pacific and finished FY24 with nearly 900 customers , each generating more than $1million in ARR.

* Splunk offers security and observability through their unified platform. With Splunk's software one can search and monitor machine generated big data through a browser interface and quicky pull real-time indexed data in storage, rather than having to have a database. They are the only vendor recognized by Gartner as a leader in the latest Magic Quadrant reports for both APM (Application Performance Monitoring) & Observability & SIEM (Security Information and Event Management).

* Splunk is using 98-104 technology products as per different sources , including HTML5, jQuery, Google Analytics, Viewport Meta,iPhone/Mobile Compatible, and Domain Not Resolving etc.

## Landscape

* This company is in the field of technology, more specifcally Cybersecurity, Operational intelligence, Cloud and AI automation for Businesses. Some other major companies in technology field are Cisco , Google , Nvidia, IBM etc

* Splunk is in the field of technology, more specifically Cybersecurity, Operational intelligence, Cloud and AI automation for Businesses. Some other major companies in technology field are Nvidia, Microsoft, Google, Datadog, Cisco , IBM etc. All these competitors have robust hardware and ecosystem to compete against Splunk’s offerings, especially Microsoft’s and Google’s ecosystem. Datadog is also a major player in the same type of products and services offering as Splunk.

* The major trends and innovations of technology and specifically AI technologies have been Nvidia’s Open AI ChatGPT, Chatbots that started with applications like Slack, and facebook messenger, but are now part of almost every major retailer’s company websites including Google and Amazon; Siri, Google Assistant, Alexa using Natural Language Processing (NLP) to respond to user questions; Explainable AI (XAI) aimed to provide an understanding of how AI works so humans can understand and trust AI generated results; and AI powered analytics for data management and timely decision making etc. 
* The most recent AI technology innovation is Nvidia’s AI Chip called Blackwell , launched March 18, 2024, that will have the increased processing power to “enable AI companies to train bigger and more intricate [AI] model”. Though companies like Microsoft and Meta committed to AMD, a rival of Nvidia, to buy AI chips from them back in Dec 2023, they will still depend on Nvidia for these high capacity Blackwell chips that are the next version to Nvidia’s Hopper. These advancements in AI technology will impact all business areas not just tech companies.


## Results

* Some of the core metrics that companies in AI field use to measure success and how Splunk is performing are as follows:
  - Quality i.e. data accuracy, efficiency, security , and scalability of AI models to be able to provide valuable insights. Splunk's products provide comprehensive security, observability and insights.
  - Cost effectiveness - Deploying Splunk can be a bit expensive.Some alternative tools to Splunk can be Datadog, Graylog, Elastisearch, Sumo Logic, Kibana though comparative cost analysis will be needed for these alternate solutions for the businesses to determine the best suited product for their needs.
 - Business Impact - Splunk's products have a made a huge impact worldwide and has been able to benefit many companies so far. A few examples are as follows:
    - The University of Fribourg was able to resolve IT issues faster and improve developer productivity with Splunk
    - Continental company revved up security , efficiency and Innovation by being able to quickly gather and share information with Splunk
    - Fannie Mae was able to help protect the Housing Finance System with single platform to monitor & analyse data across it's ecosystem using Splunk products
    - Vix made travels safer and smoother with proactive global visibility through Splunk's automation and data centralization.
    - Splunk automated time consuming tasks at Ersilia, and increased it's capacity to build AI models that could potentially help billions of underserved patients around the world.
 - Responsible AI - A responsible, trustworthy, and legislative compliant AI strategy is needed while solving business challenges and delivering customer value. The key to achieving responsible and trustworthy AI is accountability, transparency, privacy, fairness and resilience, and Splunk embraces these principles. Their AI products are driven by Domain specific for security and observability, maintaining humans in the loop i.e. AI and humans are co-pilots working alongside to deliver facts, summarize events, and bring priority alerts to the forefront, and finally allowing Splunk models to be integrated into customer's own models according to their policies and risk tolerance, providing flexible solutions. They also have a board-level committee called Cybersecurity & Data Responsibility Committee that ensures above AI principles/metrics are followed.
* Though Splunk's tool dashboard is not as reliable as Tableau and Open source tools are constantly trying to replace Splunk, Splunk has been doing well in comparison to others in the same field and Cisco wants to acquire Splunk. Cisco is expected to acquire Splunk in late Q1 or early Q2 2024 , pending regulatory approvals, for $28 billion in equity value, or $157 per share.
* 

## Recommendations

* I would recommend Splunk because of it's sleuth of operational and cyber security improvement capabilities as well as focus on Responsible AI and automation. Since there are 98-100 technologies used by Splunk , the recommendation of the technology and product will have to be dependent on each business' specific need.
